# Virat Kohli ODI Performance - Exploratory Data Analysis

## üåü Project Overview
This project dives deep into the ODI performance of one of the greatest cricketers, **Virat Kohli**. Using a comprehensive dataset of his ODI matches, I‚Äôve explored key aspects of his performance including:
- Top venues where he excels.
- His highest average scores against opposition teams.
- His performance across different batting positions, innings, and match scenarios.

**Objective**:  
To uncover hidden patterns and insights that reveal Virat Kohli‚Äôs consistency and strengths as an ODI player.

## üßπ Data Cleaning
The dataset was carefully cleaned to ensure accuracy. The steps included:
- **Missing Value Handling**: All missing values were identified and managed.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Ensured no duplicate entries that could skew analysis.
- **Standardization**: Data formats (e.g., dates, numerical columns) were standardized for smooth processing.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Below are the key questions I addressed through this analysis, along with their visual insights.

### 1. **Top 5 Grounds Where Virat Kohli Scored the Most Runs**
*Key Insight*: These venues have seen Kohli dominate the field with massive run totals.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis (Pandas)
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating detailed graphs.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: To document and present the EDA.

## üìà How to Run the Project

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virat-kohli-odi-performance-analysis.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
Change into the project directory using:

    ```bash
    cd virat-kohli-odi-performance-analysis

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
It‚Äôs a good practice to create a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies. You can do this with the following commands:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
    
4. **Install Required Dependencies**:
Install the necessary packages using pip. If you have a requirements.txt file, run:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  
5. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
Start Jupyter Notebook with the following command:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
